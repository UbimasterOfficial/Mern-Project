# Mern-Project


This is a web application developed for a Public Transport Management System project.

•  This is a web application of a project for the 3rd Year 2nd Semester of our university (SLIIT | Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology).

• The technology we have used for this is MERN Stack.
    MongoDB — document database
    Express(.js) — Node.js web framework
    React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework
    Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server

• We developed the full web application for this project, but this repository contains only the component developed by me, UbimasterOfficial. As project leader, I was assigned to develop the Route Management Part of this Transport Management System. Therefore, all the front-end and back-end parts that should be included are included here.

• While this web application can be used for educational purposes, please contact me if there are any errors.
